Welcome to CTReconstruction's documentation!
===================================

CTReconstruction is a Python library for 2D computed tomography (CT) reconstruction based on TensoFlow and PyTorch.

CTReconstruction support 2D parallel and fan beam geometries. A large number of 2D and 3D algorithms are available, including FBP, ART. (TODO)

The forward and backward projection operations can be run on CPU or GPU.

The source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/Stone-16/CTReconstruction/>`_.
